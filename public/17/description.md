# Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

## Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## Constraints

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists of only digits and English letters.

## Additional Notes
* A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam" or "racecar". The function should return the first occurring longest palindromic substring in case of multiple answers.
