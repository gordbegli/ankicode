# Subtree of Another Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
    3
   / \
  4   5
 / \
1   2
```

Input: `root = [3,4,5,1,2]`, `subRoot = [4,1,2]`
Output: `true`

**Example 2:**

Input:
```
    3
   / \
  4   5
 / \
1   2
   /
  0
```

Input: `root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0]`, `subRoot = [4,1,2]`
Output: `false`

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
* The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `-10^4 <= root.val <= 10^4`
* `-10^4 <= subRoot.val <= 10^4`

## Note

* Nodes can have `None` values, simulating missing children.
